ToyOS
=====

A small OS for the 8086 processor, like the one in my IBM PC Convertible, or IBM 5140

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things You Should Have

as86
	This is an assembler. The assembly code we write is converted to an object file by this tool.

ld86
	This is a linker. The object code generated by as86 is converted to actual machine language code by this tool. Machine language will be in a form that 8086 understands.

gcc
	The C compiler. For now we need to write a C program to transfer our OS to the floppy.

A free floppy
	A floppy will be used to store our operating system. This is also our boot device.

as86 and ld86 are both included in the package, bin86.
